The Adventurer (Hack 'N Slash, Platformer, Action)

The Adventurer is a 2D Hack 'N Slash Platformer game that invokes nostalgic feelings of old-school arcade games.
You play as an adventurer, whos best friend was recently kidnapped. With nothing but your spear, sword and shield, you must overcome waves of monsters,
and fierce bosses to bring back your friend. But be careful, things may not turn out how you envision...
